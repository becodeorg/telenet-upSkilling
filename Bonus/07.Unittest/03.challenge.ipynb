    "- Repository: `unit-testing`\n",
    "- Type of Challenge: `Learning`\n",
    "- Duration: `1 days`\n",
    "- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`\n",
    "- Team challenge : `solo`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "You will learn how to take advantage of unit testing to create robust code.\n",
    "At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Test your code with the `assert` python keyword\n",
    "- Test you code with the `unittest` module\n",
    "- Test you code with `pytest` module\n",
    "- Use Mock objects\n",
    "- Use other features from pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "You work for a company working in python. Your customer complains that your code crashes a lot and they're not able to access your services half of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see all the seniors of your company debuging all day and being mad at their colleagues breaking the code everytime they want to add a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project manager ask you to write unit tests to fix the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code to test:\n",
