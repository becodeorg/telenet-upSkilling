    "# Typing in python\n",
    "In recent years, type annotation syntax and semantics have been gradually introduced into the Python language. Typing in Python is still a fairly new and often misunderstood subject. In this course, we will present its basics, while some more advanced features will be covered in the rest of this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages include some kind of type system that formalizes which categories of objects it can work with and how those categories are treated. For instance, a type system can define a numerical type, with 42 as one example of an object of numerical type.\n",
    "\n",
    "##Â Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. This means that the Python interpreter does type checking only as code runs, and that the type of a variable is allowed to change over its lifetime. The following dummy examples demonstrate that Python has dynamic typing"
