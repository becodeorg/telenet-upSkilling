    "Inheritance is an object feature that allows you to declare that a particular class will itself be modeled on another class, called the parent class. In concrete terms, if a class \"b\" inherits the class \"a\", objects created on the model of the class \"b\" will have access to the methods and attributes of the class \"a\".\n",

    "Class \"b\" does not only use the methods and attributes of class \"a\": it will also be able to define others. Other methods and attributes that will be specific to it, in addition to the methods and attributes of class \"a\". And it will also be able to redefine the methods of the mother class.\n",

And, if your program contains multi-level inheritance, then this super() function is helpful for you.\n",

In theory a well designed API should make it always possible but we know that boundary cases exist: the original method may have side effect that you want to avoid and sometimes the API cannot be refactored to avoid them. In those cases you may prefer to skip the call to the original implementation of the method; Python does not make it mandatory, so feel free to walk that path if you think the situation requires it. Be sure to know what you are doing, however, and document why you are completely overwriting the method."
