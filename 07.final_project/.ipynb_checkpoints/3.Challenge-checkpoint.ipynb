    "# PROJECT: Flask API\n",
    "\n",
    "![Lazy picture](./assets/final.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repository: `challenge-flask-api`\n",
    "- Type of Challenge: `Learning`\n",
    "- Duration: `3 days`\n",
    "- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`\n",
    "- Deployment strategy :\n",
    "\t- Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "- Team challenge : `solo`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "You will learn how to create an API in python with the Flask module.\n",
    "At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Create a flask app\n",
    "- Add a route that show hello world\n",
    "- Add a route with GET method\n",
    "- Add a route with POST method\n",
    "- Get data from a GET request, transorm it and return it\n",
    "- Get data from a POST request, transorm it and return it\n",
    "- Deploy your API on Heroku\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "You are intern in a company to provide AI models to their customer. Unfortunatly the machine learning engineers that work with you are not very goods...\n",
    "They spend more time drinking coffee and play video games than doing their job. After few weeks their the project manager come to you and tell you that they have a client that is really upset to not have his model yet. He ask you to already create the API to get the data and return a random prediction. It will give him more time to beg the ML to finish the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to use Flask as it's the best tool to boostrap and API in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You receive this mail from the client:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Dear lazy company,\n",
    "WE NEED OUR MODEL TO BE READY BY TOMOROW OR YOU WILL BE IN TROUBLE!!!\n",
    "OUR LAWYERS ARE READDY TO SUE YOU!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test your API in 48h.\n",
    "You will find in attamchment the routes that should be working (AND I HOPE FOR YOU IT WILL):\n",
    "\n",
    "Warms regards,\n",
    "You lovely client,\n",

    "# Route to check if the server runs\n",
    "GET /status -> \"Alive!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route that to login\n",
    "POST /login -> \"Login success for user {USER_NAME_HERE} with password from length: {PASSWORD_LENGTH_HERE}!\"\n",
    "body: {\n",
    "    username: <USER_NAME_HERE>\n",
    "    password: <PASSWORD_HERE>\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route that return the prediction\n",
    "GET /predict/<seller_avaible:int>/<month:str>/<customer_visiting_website:int> -> Prediction (int between 2000 and 5000)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-have features\n",
    "- A `GET` route at `/status` that return the string \"alive\"\n",
    "- A `POST` route at `/login` that return a string containing \"Login success for user `USER_NAME_HERE` with password from length: `PASSWORD_LENGTH_HERE`!\".\n",
    "- a `GET` route at `/predict` that take 3 arguments (`month`, `customer_visiting_website`, `seller_avaible`) and return an int between `2000` and `5000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice-to-have features\n",
    "- Folow pep8 rules.\n",
    "- Add a docstring for each route.\n",
    "- Type all you functions.\n",
    "- Use `Black` to format your code.\n",
    "- Add a route that take an image and save it on the server. Return the image's server path.\n",
    "- Add unittest for at least one route.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellanous information\n",
    "Feel free to play with Flask and add you own routes!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Wrap your API in docker container.\n",
    "3. Deploy it on heroku.\n",
    "4. Pimp up the readme file:\n",
    "\t- What, Why, When, How, Who.\n",
    "\t- Pending things to do\n",
    "\t- It must contain a link to the \"live\" version. The \"live\" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.\n",
    "5. Publish the link to the \"live\" version on your startup's Ryver channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create the repository.\n",
    "2. Study the request (What & Why ?)\n",
    "3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)\n",
    "4. ULM prototype.\n",
    "5. Design your API.\n",
    "6. Create a Docker file to auto-run you API.\n",
    "7. Deploy it on Heroku.\n",
