    "\n",
    "- Repository: `challenge-flask-api`\n",
    "- Type of Challenge: `Learning`\n",
    "- Duration: `3 days`\n",
    "- Deadline: `dd/mm/yy H:i AM/PM`\n",
    "- Team challenge : `solo`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "You will learn how to create an API in python with the Flask module.\n",
    "At the end of the challenge, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Create a flask app\n",
    "- Add a route that show hello world\n",
    "- Add a route with GET method\n",
    "- Add a route with POST method\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "Your work for a company that ask you to create and API to do a demo to their new customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to use Flask as it's the best tool to boostrap and API in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You receive this mail from the client:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hi Dave,\n",
    "We would like an demo API to see what you're capable of.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will ask you the basics of APIs.\n",
    "I attach to this mail the requirements.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Route to check if the server runs\n",
    "GET /status -> \"Alive!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Route that return the user's firstname and lastname\n",
    "GET /user/<firstname:str>/<lastname:str> -> \"hello! {FIRSTNAME} {LASTNAME}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# A route that take the username + password and return the password's hash\n",
    "POST /password \n",
    "input: { username: <USERNAME>, password: <PASSWORD> }\n",

    "### Must-have features\n",
    "- A `GET` route at `/status` that return the string \"alive\".\n",
    "- A `GET` route at `/user` that return the user's firstname and lastname.\n",
    "- A `POST` route at `/password` that return a string containing \"Login success for user `USER_NAME_HERE` with password's hash. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice-to-have features\n",
    "- Folow pep8 rules.\n",
    "- Add a docstring for each route.\n",
    "- Type all you functions.\n",
    "- Use `Black` to format your code.\n",
    "- Add a route that take an image and save it on the server. Return the image's server path.\n",
    "- Add unittest for at least one route.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Miscellanous information\n",
    "Feel free to play with Flask and add you own routes!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Pimp up the readme file:\n",
    "\t- What, Why, When, How, Who.\n",
    "\t- Pending things to do\n",
    "\t- It must contain a link to the \"live\" version. The \"live\" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Create the repository.\n",
    "2. Study the request (What & Why ?)\n",
    "3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)\n",
    "4. ULM prototype.\n",
    "5. Design your API.\n",
