    "Let's discover docker volumes!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "In this module, you will learn to:\n",
    "* Understand what is a Docker volume\n",
    "* Take advantage of it\n",
    "* Improve your workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem\n",
    "In the previous module we discover that changing the file of a running container can be a pain.\n",
    "Well, it shouldn't be! Let's see how we can fix that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The solution\n",
    "And the solution is....... The volume did you guessed it? Wow I'm impressed!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a volume?\n",
    "In Docker, a volume is a bit like a hard disk. You will give a path on your computer (or in a server, usb stick,...) and you will ask it to mount it in your container in a specific place.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our case, we will ask to mount out current dirrectory in the `/app` folder of our container. It mean that it will be linked. So if we do a modification in our code, it will affect the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to do it?\n",
    "In Docker, there is multiple way of using volumes, you can create volumes and name them. So you can use it in multiple containers.\n",
    "You can create anymous volumes,...\n",
    "\n",
    "For our exercice, we will use volumes in their simplest state, anynynous volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add the `-v` flag to our run command to specify a path in our machine to link to a path in the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in our case, we want to copy everything that we have in the code directory (which is in our current working directory) in the `/app` of our container.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we could write the complete path of our current directory. But it would be long to write and anoying to type each time we change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, we will use the environement variable `$PWD`, The value of this variable will always be current working directory.\n",
    "Let's check if it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want more informations, you can read about it in the [docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). "

    "Cool, but it also mean that we can do any change in the files located in our volume (so our code directory) and it will automaticly affect the container.\n",
    "\n",

    "docker will look the content of it on our local machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can fix our code, re-run the command on our container without the need of re-build it and when we're done we can simply exit the container and our changes are gonna be saved because we did them on our machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Volumes are a super important concept in Docker, take the time to learn how you can take asvantage of them. It will save **A TON** of time, beleive me!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is that it?\n",
    "No, you can do way more things with volumes.\n",

    "* Mount files from a distant server.\n",
    "* Read process that are running on your local machine\n",
    "* And many more...\n",

    "## Next step!\n",
