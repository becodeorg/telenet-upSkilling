    "First thing first, we need to install Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "You just have to follow the [Docker well made documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running Windows or Mac -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/\n",
    "\n",
    "By default docker will need to use `sudo` each time. Let's change that:\n",

    "sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker\n",

    "\n",
    "You will need to log-out before it apply the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we can create an image\n",
    "In order to create images (or import it), we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) \n",
    "\n",
    "which is a github for docker. \n",
    "You need an image with a SQL DB in it? [There is one](https://hub.docker.com/r/mysalt/mysql). \n",

    "And a lot of other images!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your own docker file!\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, we will want to create our own images, with our own files and our own script.\n",
    "In order to do that we will create what we call a `Dockerfile`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a file that is nammed `Dockerfile` and that contain a script that Docker can understand.\n",
    "Based on that, it will create an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's create our image\n",
    "It's time! So we will create a `Dockerfile` and we will use a python image as base. It mean that we start from an existing image to build our one.\n",
    "So we don't have to start from scratch each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this file we will add a line to tell to Docker that we want to start from the official Python 3.7 image.\n",

    "\n",
    "```Dockerfile\n",
    "FROM python:3.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's add another line to copy a file. In the folder you're in there is a file nammed `hello_world.py`. This file contain a single line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello world!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a `app` folder and put our file in it. As the python image is build in top of Ubuntu, we can use all the commands that work in Ubuntu.\n",

    "Let's see some useful keyword that can be used in a Dockerfile:\n",
    "* The `RUN` keyword can be use to run a command on the system.\n",
    "* The `COPY` keyword can be used to copy a file.\n",
    "* The `WORKDIR` keyword can be used to define the path where all the command will be run starting after it.\n",
