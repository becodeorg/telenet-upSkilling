    "\n",
    "## Modules that we will use\n",
    "### Black\n",
    "[Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) is a formatter for python. It will format all your code each time you commit/push following the PEP8 standart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MyPy\n",
    "[MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) will check all your code to see if there is any typing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flake8\n",
    "[Flake8](https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/what-is-flake8-and-why-we-should-use-it-b89bd78073f2) will check if you forgot to add  docstring to your functions  and classes, if you use the correct cases in your variables/functions/classes, if you forgot to import a module that you're using, if there is unsed import,...\n",

    "### Isort\n",
    "[Isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) is an utils that will sort your imports in a way that make sense and  that is optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### And so much more\n",
    "But that's not all! You can find a lot of other modules or even create your own!\n",
    "You can for example add a step to check if there is no files bigger than X or if the branch name respect a convention,...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why using these tools?\n",
    "It will  make you gain a lot of time during PR and I recomnand you to run it before launching all your tests. It will avoid you to run test that take a while to run to discover, during the last test that you forgot an import in a file. Or simply improve  you code's speed because you're sure that there is no module imported when you don't use it. The formating will also improve a lot the readibilty of your code and that's something that you can totally forget to focus on the most import thing: fixing your business problem and not check if you haven't forgot to type all the functions or to add  a space after a parenthesis.
