    "## Introduction\n",
    "It's also possible to connect with SSH to a server and to perform actions with python. It become really  handy when we want to automate deployment, to perform speficactions on a server,...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "We will need single python library:\n",
    "* [paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's install it!\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install paramiko\n",
    "```\n",

    "## What can we do with it?\n",
    "Basicly everything that we can do when we're connection with SSH to a server.\n",
    "Paramiko will help us to connect to the machine and then python's subprocess can perform any bash command and get the ouput back in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Our goal will be: \n",
    "* Connect a server with python.\n",
    "* Execute a bash command on it.\n",
    "* Get the output back and print it.\n",
    "* Creating a usefull script with our new knowledge."
